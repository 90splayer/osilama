                <p>Iâ€™m David Osilama, a user-centered product designer who creates scalable designs that blend business goals with user needs.</p>
                <p>I don't just design pretty things, I dive into problems from the user perspective, research market competitors before crafting products that solves the problems.</p>

                <p>I'm a pro at using Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects to bring my designs to life. I'm always learning and experimenting with new tools to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
                <p>I work well in an agile system independently and collaborate well with cross functional teams.</p>
